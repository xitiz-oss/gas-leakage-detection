<h1 align="center" id="title">LPG Gas Leakage Detection System</h1>

<p id="description">This innovative project aims to develop a comprehensive gas leakage detection system by harnessing the capabilities of the ESP8266 microcontroller for detecting gas. The LPG gas leakage detection system is built to solve the problem by successfully detecting any gas leaks and triggering the various alert mechanism as well as automatically shut off the regulator.</p>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Alert mechanism that sends an email to the user when hazardous gas level is detected
*   Real-time gas level visualization feature by integrating cloud
*   Capable of detecting gas levels accurately with the utilization of MQ-2 gas sensor
*   Takes a series of safety actions when gas levels reach a hazardous point by integrating components like servo motor buzzer LED light and exhaust fan
